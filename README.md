# Portfolio

Created with custom css, this website showcases my portfolio of projects in web development and design.

#### Overview:
* The ___Portfolio__ page lists and details the projects I've worked on, and each listing provides:
  * A "Demo" link which leads to the live project
  * An "Image Gallery" link which hosts a collection of images and descriptions about the project
  * A "View Code" link which leads to the project's GitHub repository
* The __About__ page that provides information on my background, skills, and community involvement
* The __Contact__ page provides general information and contact details
